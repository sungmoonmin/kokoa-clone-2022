# Kokoa Clone 2022

My first website project

I made Kakao Talk Clone using HTML & CSS.  
This is based on cool lectures from "Nomad Coders : 코코아톡 클론코딩"

Thanks to my awesome teacher(Nico), I was able to start learning.  
now I have confidence to make my own website or build code stuff by continuous learning(with self-studying, lectures, papers and so on...).  
Let's keep going! :)

HTML & CSS are so much fun!
